- 👋 Hi, I’m @FilipeJFFA
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring and learn more about programming.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning the C language, Excel, and VisualBasic.
- 💞️ "I'm looking to collaborate on simple projects because I'm still learning. Once I graduate, I'll be able to contribute to more advanced projects.
- 📫 You can reach me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipe-araújo-6b06102a1/."
